                    <h2>The history of Football</h2>
                    <p>The first known examples of a team game involving a ball,
                        which was made out of a rock, occurred in old Mesoamerican 
                        cultures for over 3,000 years ago. 
                        The ball would symbolize the sun and 
                        the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods.</p>

                    <p>It is therefore hard to decide which the first football club was
                          Some historians suggest that it was the Foot-Ball Club formed 1824 in Edinburgh.
                            The oldest among professional football clubs is the
                            English club Notts County that was formed in 1862 and still exists today.
